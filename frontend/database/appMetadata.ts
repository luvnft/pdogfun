  description: "Designed to simplify the creation of meme coins. Allows anyone to quickly and easily launch their own meme token without deep technical knowledge. Users can create a token by uploading an image, choosing a name and symbol, and paying a small fee. The platform uses a bond curve pricing model, where the token price rises as more people buy it, creating liquidity before listing on decentralized exchanges.",
